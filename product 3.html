            <h4> Benefits Of Using Sulphate Free Shampoo And Conditioner</h4>
            <p>Reduced scalp irritation, Reduced frizz, Reduced irritation of skin around the hair (neck, back, hairline acne), Leaves hair softer and more conditioned and Leaves curly hair more intact. Sulfate–free shampoo can make a difference to hair that is lacking in moisture, or hair that is color-treated. Normal shampoo with sulfates can strip the color out of your color–treated hair more quickly than sulfate-free shampoo and can be a contributing factor to dryness in frizzy or natural hair. These may not lather as much, but they help your hair maintain moisture that may be lost from your color treatments, too. Additionally, sulfates are known to cause hair frizz. When sulfates make contact with your hair, they create a negative electrical charge, which can create frizz after you shampoo.</p>
