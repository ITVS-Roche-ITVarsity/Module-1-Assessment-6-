            <h4> The Best Way To Use A Hairbrush</h4>
            <p>Use the comb or brush on the very ends of your hair first.Comb down and gently remove any tangles. Small brush strokes are best.If your hair is particularly tangled or knotted, spray on a hair detangler or a leave-in conditioner first to give more slip to your hair strands.If your hair routine involves 100 brush strokes a day, you might want to rethink your strategy. This is a healthy way to distribute your scalp's natural oils through your hair â€” but only if you do it gently. Boar bristle brushes are popular because they won't tear or split your hair. They're also thought to increase blood flow to the hair follicles, which in turn stimulates growth. When it comes to size, go for a smaller brush that can work closer to the root to create more volume.</p>
