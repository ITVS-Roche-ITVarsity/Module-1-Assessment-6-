            <h4> Why Its Important TO Use Heat Protectant</h4>
            <p><ul>
               <li> Heat protectants add a barrier between your styling tool and your hair, sealing in moisture and fending off frizz. </li>
                  <li> They also work to smooth the cuticle, making your hair look smooth and feel soft.</li>
           <li> When you expose your hair to heat every time you style your hair without protection, it can lead to hair damage. Heat can dry out your strands, cause split ends and breakage, and make your hair look dull, among other issues.</li>
