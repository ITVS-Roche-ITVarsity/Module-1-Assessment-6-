            <h4>Why Use A Wide Tooth Comb</h4>
            <p>Wide tooth combs, as hinted at by their name, have thicker teeth to allow larger amounts of hair through. This should be a preferred choice for those with thick, curly, or tangled hair. If you're coming out of the shower or your hair is otherwise damp or wet, a wide tooth comb is the only way to go. The wide-tooth design moves easily through curls without breaking or damaging them, and the long handle makes this an easy-to-grip option for those who need a firm hold when detangling. During your shower, consider using a wide-toothed comb to work the conditioner through your strands. To minimize damage, Norton suggests using a comb to work out tangles from the bottom, working your way up to the roots. Bottom line: Use a brush only on dry hair and a wide-toothed comb on wet hair.</p>
